# LibMat

An attempt to implement matrix manipulation in C.

**Warning!** This project is still under construction and is not perfect - there are a lot of unhandled errors and unprotected memory, so it is not recommended to use it yet!

## Motivation

I have encountered challenges in CTFs where I had to manipulate matrices. 
It was quite fun to do it by hand, but it was also very time-consuming. 
I tried to do it using Python and it was both easy and efficient, 
so I decided to implement it in C to learn more about it.

TODO:
- Provide error handling
- Protect the memory and memory leaks
- Get why inverse doesn't work :')
